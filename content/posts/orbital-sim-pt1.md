## Historical Background
### Predicting the Next Solar Eclipse (and the 1,000 Following It)
If you are reading this in September of 2025, the next total solar eclipse the Earth will experience will occur on August 12, 2026. If you're planning on making the most out of your eclipse viewing experience, you'll also want to know which regions fall under the eclipse's central path. For the August 2026 solar eclipse, these regions are Greenland, Iceland and Spain.

But what about readers who might've missed the August 2026 solar eclipse (and quite a few after that), and are now reading this in September of 2995? For almost any other subject, I'd advise you to refer to a more contemporary source. While that's still advisable for a variety of reasons, 30th century readers can safely bet that the next optimal solar eclipse viewing experience will occur on January 11, 2996, near Smyley Island, Antarctica. If climate trends continue, it'll likely be quite a pleasant vacation spot by then.

So how are we able to predict the time and place of such distant astronomical events with such precision? While these two dates come from NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak's [Five Millenium Catalog of Solar Eclipses](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SEcatalog.html), who we will discuss more in depth later, his work is the computational result of a remarkably stable and predictable orbital system. Every day, every month, and every year, we intuitively expect the distances traveled by the Earth and the Moon to be consistent. So consistent in fact, that we might even describe the solar system as a sort of celestial timepiece. This description however, fails to fully convey the depth of the relationship between the heavens and timekeeping. It is in fact the solar system, and in particular the Sun-Earth-Moon system, which is the model timepiece after which all others are fashioned. Our very discretization of time into seconds, minutes and hours is based upon the motion of celestial bodies. 

### Celestial Clockwork
In 1687, Isaac Newton published his *Principia* which included his first formulation of his universal law of gravitation. Following *Principia*'s publication, Newton and his contemporaries would set about searching for a way to use Newton's law to describe the motion of the solar system for all time which, in many of their minds, involved solving the *n*-body problem, which we will soon elaborate on further. Their efforts would ignite a nearly three centuries-long debate about solar system-staability, God and the nature of the universe. Throughout this debate, the cultural presence of the "celestial timepiece" was ever-present, and shaped many of the arguments made.
