## Celestial Clockwork and Solar System-Stability
### Predicting the Next Solar Eclipse (and the 1,000 Following It)
If you are reading this in September of 2025, the next total solar eclipse the Earth will experience will occur on August 12, 2026. If you'd like to book a hotel under the central path of the eclipse (the regions from which a total eclipse is best visible), you should also know that you should plan your trip to Greenland, Iceland or Spain.

What about those readers who missed the August 2026 solar eclipse (and quite a few after that), and are now reading this in September of 2995? For almost any other subject, such a reader would be advised to refer to updated sources. While that's still advisable for a variety of reasons, future readers from the late 30th century, can rest assured that if they'd like to experience the next total solar eclipse, they may book a ticket to Smyley Island, Antarctica before January 11, 2996. You may need to explore nearby car rentals as well, because according to Google reviews, public transport is "almost non-existent".

So how are we able to state the time and place of such distant astronomical events with such precision? While these two dates come from NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak's [Five Millenium Catalog of Solar Eclipses](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SEcatalog.html), who we will discuss more in depth later, his work is the computational result of a remarkably stable and predictable orbital system. Every day, every month, and every year, we intuitively expect the distances traveled by the Earth and the Moon to be consistent. So consistent in fact, that we might even describe the solar system as a sort of celestial timepiece. This description however, fails to fully convey the depth of the relationship between the heavens and timekeeping. It is in fact the solar system, and in particular the Sun-Earth-Moon system, which is the model timepiece after which all others are fashioned. Our very discretization of time into seconds, minutes and hours is based upon the motion of celestial bodies. 

### Grappling with the *n*-body Problem: When the Celestial Clock Breaks
Astronomers and physicists of the pre-Contemporary era were deeply invested in the idea of the heavens as a model timepiece.
