## About Dune Labs
Welcome to Dune Labs, a space dedicated to fostering interest in science and mathematics. Here you'll find a growing collection of lessons, programs, and interactive games covering a diverse range of topics.

The content found here ranges from practical explorations for traditional mathematics students to deeper dives into abstract concepts and their connections to the imaginative worlds of science fiction.

## About the Author
My name is Emaad Khan. I am an undergraduate student at The Ohio State University pursuing a dual degree in Applied Mathematics. This site, Dune Labs acts as a sort of digital notebook, where I can document and share my experiences with numerical solutions, machine learning, interactive design and more!

### Background
I began studying undergraduate mathematics, as most students do, with the introductory Calculus course series. I've always been interested in mathematics, however it did not become my primary focus until I completed Calculus II at Ohio State. In particular, learning about series, as well as the convergence and divergence of functions, really demonstrated to me how mathematics is not about just computation. However, while my coursework has been both engaging and fascinating, I often felt that I wasn't making a real connection between practical problems, and their mathematical solutions. That's the journey I'm documenting here on Dune Labsâ€”for myself, and for anyone who feels the same.

### Core Interests
As mentioned above, my passion lies at the intersection of theory and application. I want to invest time into asking the question, "How can we take this abstract concept, and apply it to a real-world problem?" My goal is to make that journey of discovery an interactive experience. 

This passion also extends to science fiction, which in many ways, represents many connections between academic theory and the limits of human imagination. I enjoy deconstructing how SciFi franchises explore technological possibilities and their sociological implications, using them as a lens to better understand our own world.
